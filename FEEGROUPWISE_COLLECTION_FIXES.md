# Fee Group-wise Collection Report - Fixes Applied

## Date: 2025-10-10

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the fixes applied to the Fee Group-wise Collection Report to address three key issues:

1. **Remove Additional Fees** - Exclude additional fees from report calculations
2. **Fix Fee Group Total Calculation** - Ensure accurate total amounts for fee groups
3. **Fix Balance Calculation Logic** - Prevent negative balance display

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Remove Additional Fees from Report

**Problem:** The report was including both regular fees (from `fee_groups`, `student_fees_master`) and additional fees (from `fee_groupsadding`, `student_fees_masteradding`), which was causing incorrect totals.

**Solution:** Modified the model to only query and return regular fees data, excluding all additional fees tables.

**Files Modified:**
- `application/models/Feegroupwise_model.php`
- `api/application/models/Feegroupwise_model.php`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `getFeeGroupwiseCollection()` method to only call `getRegularFeesCollection()` and removed the call to `getAdditionalFeesCollection()`
- Updated `getFeeGroupwiseDetailedData()` method to only call `getRegularFeesDetailedData()` and removed the call to `getAdditionalFeesDetailedData()`
- Updated `getAllFeeGroups()` method to only return regular fee groups, excluding additional fee groups from the dropdown filter

### 2. Fix Fee Group Total Calculation

**Problem:** The total amount calculation was potentially including amounts from additional fees, leading to incorrect totals.

**Solution:** By removing additional fees from the queries (as described above), the total amounts now correctly reflect only the regular fee group amounts from `student_fees_master.amount`.

**Impact:**
- Fee group totals now accurately represent the sum of regular fees assigned to students
- The calculation uses `COALESCE(SUM(sfm.amount), 0)` from `student_fees_master` table only
- Collections are calculated from `student_fees_deposite` table only, filtered by `fee_groups_feetype_id` to ensure only payments for the specific fee group are counted

### 3. Fix Balance Calculation Logic

**Problem:** When collection amount exceeded the total amount, the balance was showing as a negative value instead of zero.

**Solution:** Implemented proper balance calculation using `max(0, total_amount - amount_collected)` formula to ensure balance never goes negative.

**Files Modified:**
- `application/models/Feegroupwise_model.php`
- `api/application/models/Feegroupwise_model.php`
- `application/controllers/Financereports.php`
- `api/application/controllers/Feegroupwise_collection_report_api.php`

**Changes Made:**

#### In Model Files (both application and api):

**`getFeeGroupwiseCollection()` method:**
```php
// OLD CODE:
$row->balance_amount = $row->total_amount - $row->amount_collected;

// NEW CODE:
// FIXED: Balance should never be negative - if collection >= total, balance = 0
$row->balance_amount = max(0, $row->total_amount - $row->amount_collected);
```

**`getFeeGroupwiseDetailedData()` method:**
```php
// OLD CODE:
$row->balance_amount = $row->total_amount - $row->amount_collected;

// NEW CODE:
// FIXED: Balance should never be negative - if collection >= total, balance = 0
$row->balance_amount = max(0, $row->total_amount - $row->amount_collected);
```

**Payment Status Logic:**
```php
// OLD CODE:
if ($row->balance_amount == 0 && $row->amount_collected > 0) {
    $row->payment_status = 'Paid';
} elseif ($row->amount_collected > 0 && $row->balance_amount < 0) {
    $row->payment_status = 'Overpaid';
} elseif ($row->amount_collected > 0) {
    $row->payment_status = 'Partial';
} else {
    $row->payment_status = 'Pending';
}

// NEW CODE:
// FIXED: Check if collection >= total for "Paid" status
if ($row->amount_collected >= $row->total_amount && $row->amount_collected > 0) {
    $row->payment_status = 'Paid';
} elseif ($row->amount_collected > 0) {
    $row->payment_status = 'Partial';
} else {
    $row->payment_status = 'Pending';
}
```

#### In Controller Files (both application and api):

**`getFeeGroupwiseData()` method / `filter()` method:**
```php
// Added comment and safety check
// Note: balance_amount from model is already calculated as max(0, total - collected)
foreach ($data as $row) {
    $summary['total_amount'] += $row->total_amount;
    $summary['total_collected'] += $row->amount_collected;
    $summary['total_balance'] += $row->balance_amount;
}

// Ensure total balance is never negative (in case of overpayments)
$summary['total_balance'] = max(0, $summary['total_balance']);
```

## Impact Summary

### What Changed:
1. ✅ **Additional fees are now excluded** from the report entirely
2. ✅ **Fee group totals are accurate** - only regular fees are counted
3. ✅ **Balance calculation is correct** - never shows negative values
4. ✅ **Payment status is accurate** - "Paid" status when collection >= total

### What Stays the Same:
- Report URL: `http://localhost/amt/financereports/feegroupwise_collection`
- Filter functionality (session, class, section, fee group, date range)
- Export functionality (Excel, CSV)
- Grid, chart, and table displays
- API endpoints remain functional

### Database Tables Affected:
**Now Used (Regular Fees):**
- `fee_groups`
- `fee_session_groups`
- `fee_groups_feetype`
- `student_fees_master`
- `student_fees_deposite`

**No Longer Used (Additional Fees):**
- `fee_groupsadding`
- `fee_session_groupsadding`
- `fee_groups_feetypeadding`
- `student_fees_masteradding`
- `student_fees_depositeadding`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with various scenarios:**
   - Students with full payment (collection = total)
   - Students with partial payment (collection < total)
   - Students with overpayment (collection > total)
   - Students with no payment (collection = 0)

2. **Verify calculations:**
   - Check that fee group totals match the sum of regular fees only
   - Verify that balance shows 0 when collection >= total
   - Confirm that balance shows correct amount when collection < total

3. **Test filters:**
   - Verify fee group dropdown only shows regular fee groups
   - Test filtering by class, section, and date range
   - Ensure summary statistics are accurate

4. **Test exports:**
   - Export to Excel and verify data accuracy
   - Export to CSV and verify data accuracy

## Files Modified

1. `application/models/Feegroupwise_model.php` - Main model for web application
2. `api/application/models/Feegroupwise_model.php` - API model
3. `application/controllers/Financereports.php` - Main controller
4. `api/application/controllers/Feegroupwise_collection_report_api.php` - API controller

---

## Notes

- The changes maintain backward compatibility with the existing report structure
- No database schema changes were required
- The API endpoints continue to work with the same request/response format
- All existing functionality (filters, exports, charts) remains intact
