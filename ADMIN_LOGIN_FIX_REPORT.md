## Date: 2025-10-10

---

## Issue Summary

**Problem:** Unable to login to the system using superadmin credentials
- **Email:** amaravatijuniorcollege@gmail.com
- **Password:** 2017@amaravathi
- **Login URL:** http://localhost/amt/site/login

---

## Investigation Results

### 1. User Account Status

✅ **User Found in Database**
- **User ID:** 1
- **Name:** Super Admin
- **Email:** amaravatijuniorcollege@gmail.com
- **Employee ID:** 9000
- **Account Status:** Active (is_active = 1)

### 2. User Roles

✅ **Roles Assigned Correctly**
- **Role ID:** 7
- **Role Name:** Super Admin
- User has proper superadmin privileges

### 3. Password Issue Identified

❌ **Root Cause: Password Hash Mismatch**

**Problem Details:**
- The password stored in the database was hashed with a different value than the provided password
- The stored hash: `$2y$10$Q.0spRW.easkbRVJ.mS6o.Gk2Vmf4bX.qhh.IA9O6T4...`
- When verifying the password "2017@amaravathi" against this hash, it failed
- This indicates the password was either:
  - Changed previously to a different value
  - Corrupted during a database migration
  - Never set to the expected value

## Authentication System Analysis

### How the System Works

The school management system uses the following authentication flow for admin/staff login:

1. **Login Controller:** `application/controllers/Site.php` → `login()` method
2. **Model:** `application/models/Staff_model.php` → `checkLogin()` method
3. **Database Table:** `staff` table
4. **Password Hashing:** PHP's `password_hash()` function (bcrypt algorithm)
5. **Password Verification:** PHP's `password_verify()` function

### Code Flow

```php
// Site.php (Controller)
$login_post = array(
    'email'    => $this->input->post('username'),
    'password' => $this->input->post('password'),
);
$result = $this->staff_model->checkLogin($login_post);

// Staff_model.php (Model)
public function checkLogin($data)
{
    $record = $this->getByEmail($data['email']);
    if ($record) {
        $pass_verify = $this->enc_lib->passHashDyc($data['password'], $record->password);
        if ($pass_verify) {
            $roles = $this->staffroles_model->getStaffRoles($record->id);
            $record->roles = array($roles[0]->name => $roles[0]->role_id);
            return $record;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

// Enc_lib.php (Library)
function passHashDyc($password, $encrypt_password) {
    $isPasswordCorrect = password_verify($password, $encrypt_password);
    return $isPasswordCorrect;
}
```

### Database Schema

**Table:** `staff`

Key fields for authentication:
- `id` - Primary key
- `email` - Login username (email address)
- `password` - Hashed password (60 characters, bcrypt)
- `is_active` - Account status (1 = active, 0 = disabled)
- `name` - First name
- `surname` - Last name

**Table:** `staff_roles`

Links staff to their roles:
- `staff_id` - Foreign key to staff.id
- `role_id` - Foreign key to roles.id

## Solution Applied

### Fix Implemented

**Script Created:** `check_and_fix_admin_login.php`

**Actions Performed:**

1. ✅ **Connected to Database**
   - Database: `amt`
   - Host: `localhost`
   - Connection successful

2. ✅ **Verified User Exists**
   - Found user with email: amaravatijuniorcollege@gmail.com
   - User ID: 1

3. ✅ **Checked Account Status**
   - Account is active (is_active = 1)
   - No changes needed

4. ✅ **Verified User Roles**
   - User has Super Admin role (role_id = 7)
   - Roles properly assigned

5. ✅ **Identified Password Issue**
   - Current password hash did not match provided password
   - Password verification failed

6. ✅ **Updated Password**
   - Generated new password hash using `password_hash()`
   - New hash: `$2y$10$jLkd986tLrFHb2whMY5tYOBCR4oeqQDNakP6jldSOkN...`
   - Hash length: 60 characters (correct for bcrypt)
   - Updated staff table with new hash

7. ✅ **Verified Fix**
   - Re-verified password against new hash
   - Verification successful
   - Password now matches expected value

## Current Status

### ✅ FIXED - Login Now Working

**Working Credentials:**
```
Email: amaravatijuniorcollege@gmail.com
Password: 2017@amaravathi
Login URL: http://localhost/amt/site/login
```

**Account Details:**
- **User ID:** 1
- **Name:** Super Admin
- **Role:** Super Admin (Full Access)
- **Status:** Active
- **Password:** Correctly hashed and verified

## What Was Wrong

**Issue:** Password hash mismatch

**Explanation:**
The password stored in the database was hashed with a different value than what you were trying to use. This could have happened due to:

1. **Previous Password Change:** Someone may have changed the password previously
2. **Database Import/Migration:** Password might have been corrupted during a database restore
3. **Initial Setup:** Password might never have been set to the expected value
4. **Manual Database Edit:** Someone might have manually edited the password field incorrectly

**Why Login Failed:**
- When you entered "2017@amaravathi", the system hashed it and compared it to the stored hash
- The stored hash was for a different password
- `password_verify()` returned false
- Login was rejected

---

## What Was Fixed

**Fix Applied:**
1. Generated a new bcrypt hash for the password "2017@amaravathi"
2. Updated the `staff` table with the correct hash
3. Verified the new hash works correctly

**Technical Details:**
```sql
UPDATE staff 
SET password = '$2y$10$jLkd986tLrFHb2whMY5tYOBCR4oeqQDNakP6jldSOkN...' 
WHERE id = 1;
```

The new hash was generated using PHP's `password_hash()` function with the PASSWORD_DEFAULT algorithm (bcrypt), which is the same method used by the application.

## Testing Confirmation

### ✅ Login Should Now Work

**Steps to Test:**

1. Open browser and navigate to: `http://localhost/amt/site/login`
2. Enter credentials:
   - **Username/Email:** amaravatijuniorcollege@gmail.com
   - **Password:** 2017@amaravathi
3. Click "Sign In"
4. You should be redirected to: `http://localhost/amt/admin/admin/dashboard`

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Login successful

## Files Created

1. ✅ `check_and_fix_admin_login.php` - Diagnostic and fix script
2. ✅ `ADMIN_LOGIN_FIX_REPORT.md` - This comprehensive report

## Additional Notes

### Password Security

The system uses industry-standard password hashing:
- **Algorithm:** bcrypt (via PHP's `password_hash()`)
- **Cost Factor:** 10 (default)
- **Hash Length:** 60 characters
- **Format:** `$2y$10$...` (bcrypt identifier)

### Future Password Changes

If you need to change the password in the future:

**Option 1: Use the Forgot Password Feature**
1. Go to login page
2. Click "Forgot Password"
3. Enter email: amaravatijuniorcollege@gmail.com
4. Follow the reset link sent to your email

**Option 2: Use the Fix Script**
1. Edit `check_and_fix_admin_login.php`
2. Change the `$admin_password` variable to your new password
3. Run: `C:\xampp\php\php.exe check_and_fix_admin_login.php`

**Option 3: Direct Database Update**
```php
<?php
$new_password = 'your_new_password';
$hashed = password_hash($new_password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
// Update database with $hashed value
?>
```
