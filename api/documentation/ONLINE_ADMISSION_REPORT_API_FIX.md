# Online Admission Report API - Database Column Fix

## Date: October 8, 2025

## Issue Reported

**Error Message:**
```
A Database Error Occurred
Error Number: 1054
Unknown column 'online_admission_payment.amount' in 'field list'
```

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT online_admission_payment.online_admission_id) as total_admissions,
       SUM(online_admission_payment.amount) as total_amount,
       online_admission_payment.payment_mode,
       COUNT(online_admission_payment.id) as payment_count
FROM online_admission_payment
WHERE DATE_FORMAT(online_admission_payment.date, "%Y-%m-%d") >= '2025-01-01'
AND DATE_FORMAT(online_admission_payment.date, "%Y-%m-%d") <= '2025-12-31'
GROUP BY online_admission_payment.payment_mode
```

## Root Cause

The `online_admission_payment` table uses the column name `paid_amount` instead of `amount`. The API model was incorrectly referencing `amount` in multiple places.

## Files Fixed

### 1. api/application/models/Onlinestudent_model.php

**Fixed Methods:**

#### getOnlineAdmissionPaymentSummary()
**Before:**
```php
$this->db->select('COUNT(DISTINCT online_admission_payment.online_admission_id) as total_admissions, 
                  SUM(online_admission_payment.amount) as total_amount,
                  online_admission_payment.payment_mode,
                  COUNT(online_admission_payment.id) as payment_count');
```

**After:**
```php
$this->db->select('COUNT(DISTINCT online_admission_payment.online_admission_id) as total_admissions, 
                  SUM(online_admission_payment.paid_amount) as total_amount,
                  online_admission_payment.payment_mode,
                  COUNT(online_admission_payment.id) as payment_count');
```

#### getOnlineAdmissionsByClass()
**Before:**
```php
$this->db->select('classes.class, 
                  sections.section,
                  COUNT(DISTINCT online_admissions.id) as admission_count,
                  SUM(online_admission_payment.amount) as total_amount');
```

**After:**
```php
$this->db->select('classes.class, 
                  sections.section,
                  COUNT(DISTINCT online_admissions.id) as admission_count,
                  SUM(online_admission_payment.paid_amount) as total_amount');
```

#### getOnlineAdmissionFeeCollectionReport()
**Also Fixed:**
- Added proper SQL escaping using `$this->db->escape()` for date parameters

### 2. api/application/controllers/Online_admission_fee_report_api.php

**Fixed in filter() method:**

**Before:**
```php
foreach ($admissions as $admission) {
    $total_amount += floatval($admission['amount']);
    if (!in_array($admission['online_admission_id'], $unique_admissions)) {
        $unique_admissions[] = $admission['online_admission_id'];
        $total_admissions++;
    }
}
```

**After:**
```php
foreach ($admissions as $admission) {
    $total_amount += floatval($admission['paid_amount']);
    if (!in_array($admission['online_admission_id'], $unique_admissions)) {
        $unique_admissions[] = $admission['online_admission_id'];
        $total_admissions++;
    }
}
```

### 3. api/documentation/ONLINE_ADMISSION_FEE_REPORT_API_README.md

**Updated Documentation:**
- Changed all references from `amount` to `paid_amount` in:
  - Response examples
  - Field descriptions table

**Example Response Field:**
```json
{
    "paid_amount": "15000.00"
}
```

**Field Description:**
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `data[].paid_amount` | string | Payment amount |

## Summary of Changes

### Column Name Changes
- ❌ `online_admission_payment.amount` (incorrect)
- ✅ `online_admission_payment.paid_amount` (correct)

### Files Modified (3)
1. `api/application/models/Onlinestudent_model.php` - Fixed 3 methods
2. `api/application/controllers/Online_admission_fee_report_api.php` - Fixed calculation loop
3. `api/documentation/ONLINE_ADMISSION_FEE_REPORT_API_README.md` - Updated documentation

### Files Created (1)
1. `test_online_admission_filter.php` - Test script for verification

## Status

✅ **FIXED AND VERIFIED**

The Online Admission Report API is now working correctly with the proper column name `paid_amount`. All database queries execute successfully and return valid JSON responses.

## API Endpoints Status

- ✅ `POST /api/online-admission-report/list` - WORKING
- ✅ `POST /api/online-admission-report/filter` - WORKING (FIXED)

## Notes

1. The original web page view (`application/views/financereports/onlineadmission.php`) correctly uses `$collect->paid_amount`, which confirmed the correct column name.

2. The fix also added proper SQL escaping using `$this->db->escape()` for security.

3. The API now returns 0 records because there's no data in the `online_admission_payment` table for the current year, but the structure and queries are correct.

4. When data is present, the API will return complete admission details including:
   - Student information (name, mobile, email)
   - Class and section
   - Payment details (amount, mode, date, transaction ID)
   - Additional info (hostel, transport, house)
