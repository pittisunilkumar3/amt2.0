## üìä Filtering Behavior

| Filter Combination | Result |
|-------------------|--------|
| Empty `{}` | Returns all sessions with complete hierarchy and all students |
| `session_id` only | Returns that session with all its classes, sections, and students |
| `session_id` + `class_id` | Returns that class with all its sections and students |
| All three filters | Returns specific section with its students only |

---

## ‚ö° Key Features

‚úÖ **Student Details** - Comprehensive student information included  
‚úÖ **Statistics** - Provides counts of sessions, classes, sections, students  
‚úÖ **Flexible Filtering** - Filter at any level (session/class/section)  
‚úÖ **Empty Body Support** - `{}` returns all data gracefully  
‚úÖ **Active Students Only** - Only includes students with `is_active = 'yes'`  
‚úÖ **Timestamp** - Includes response generation timestamp  

---

## üìù Important Notes

1. **POST Method Only** - GET requests will return 405 error
2. **Headers Required** - Both `Client-Service` and `Auth-Key` headers are mandatory
3. **Empty Body Valid** - `{}` is a valid request that returns all data
4. **Complete Hierarchy** - Sessions ‚Üí Classes ‚Üí Sections ‚Üí Students
5. **Active Students Only** - Only students with `is_active = 'yes'` are included
6. **Ordered Results** - Students ordered by admission number
7. **Full Student Data** - Includes all essential student information
8. **Performance** - May be slower with large datasets due to student data

## üîÑ Comparison with API 1

| Feature | API 1 (`/get`) | API 2 (`/get-hierarchy`) |
|---------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Student Data | ‚ùå Not included | ‚úÖ Included with full details |
| Fee Groups | ‚úÖ Included | ‚ùå Not included |
| Fee Types | ‚úÖ Included | ‚ùå Not included |
| Staff Collectors | ‚úÖ Included | ‚ùå Not included |
| Statistics | ‚ùå Not included | ‚úÖ Included |
| Timestamp | ‚ùå Not included | ‚úÖ Included |
| Performance | ‚ö° Faster | üê¢ Slower (more data) |
| Use Case | Fee filters | Complete academic data |

## üí° Performance Tips

1. **Use Filters** - Apply filters to reduce response size
2. **Cache Results** - Cache responses for frequently accessed data
3. **Specific Queries** - Use section_id filter for smallest dataset
4. **Off-Peak Hours** - Run large queries during off-peak hours
5. **Pagination** - Consider implementing pagination for very large datasets
