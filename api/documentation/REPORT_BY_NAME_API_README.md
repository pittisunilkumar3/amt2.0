## Endpoints

### 1. Filter Endpoint
**URL:** `/api/report-by-name/filter`

**Purpose:** Search students by name and retrieve their fee reports

**Request Body Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| search_text | string | No | Text to search in firstname, middlename, lastname, or admission_no |
| class_id | string/int | No | Class ID to filter by |
| section_id | string/int | No | Section ID to filter by |
| session_id | string/int | No | Academic session ID to filter by |

**Graceful Null/Empty Handling:**
- Empty request `{}` returns first 100 students (limited for performance)
- `null` or empty string parameters are treated as "return ALL records" for that parameter
- Search is case-insensitive and uses LIKE matching

**Example Requests:**

1. **Empty Request (First 100 Students):**
```json
{}
```

2. **Search by Name:**
```json
{
    "search_text": "John"
}

```json
{
    "search_text": "ADM001"
}
```

4. **Search with Class Filter:**
```json

    "search_text": "John",
    "class_id": "1"
}
```

5. **Search with Multiple Filters:**
```json

## Notes

1. **Search Behavior:**
   - Searches in firstname, middlename, lastname, and admission_no fields
   - Uses LIKE matching (case-insensitive)
   - Partial matches are supported (e.g., "Joh" will match "John")

2. **Performance:**
   - Empty request limited to 100 records to prevent large result sets
   - Use filters to narrow down results for better performance
   - Consider adding pagination for large datasets

3. **Fee Calculation:**
   - Total Fee: Sum of all fee amounts
   - Deposit: Sum of all payments made
   - Discount: Sum of all discounts applied
   - Fine: Sum of all fines
   - Balance: (Total Fee - Discount) - Deposit + Fine

4. **Use Cases:**
   - Quick student lookup by name
   - Search by partial name
   - Find student by admission number
   - Get fee summary for searched students
