## üß™ Test with Your Exact Payload

### Test Command

```bash
curl -X POST "https://school.cyberdetox.in/api/report-by-name/filter" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": 20,
    "class_id": "19",
    "section_id": "36",
    "student_id": "1038"
  }'
```

### Expected Result

‚úÖ **Should now return student data** instead of empty array

```json
{
    "status": 1,
    "message": "Report by name retrieved successfully",
    "filters_applied": {
        "search_text": null,
        "class_id": "19",
        "section_id": "36",
        "session_id": 20  // ‚úÖ Now shows session_id
    },
    "total_records": 1,  // ‚úÖ Should be > 0
    "data": [
        {
            "student_session_id": "...",
            "firstname": "...",
            "lastname": "...",
            "class": "...",
            "section": "...",
            "admission_no": "...",
            "father_name": "...",
            "mobileno": "...",
            "fees": [
                // Fee details here
            ],
            "transport_fees": []
        }
    ],
    "timestamp": "2025-10-10 21:24:01"
}
```

## üîç What Was Fixed

### Before Fix ‚ùå
- `session_id` parameter was ignored
- Always used current session
- Returned 0 records when filtering by old session

### After Fix ‚úÖ
- `session_id` parameter is now accepted and used
- Can filter by any session
- Returns correct data for specified session

---

## üìã Additional Test Cases

### Test 1: Without session_id (Uses Current Session)
```bash
curl -X POST "https://school.cyberdetox.in/api/report-by-name/filter" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -d '{
    "class_id": "19",
    "section_id": "36"
  }'
```

### Test 2: Only Student ID with Session
```bash
curl -X POST "https://school.cyberdetox.in/api/report-by-name/filter" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": 20,
    "student_id": "1038"
  }'
```

### Test 3: All Students in a Session
```bash
curl -X POST "https://school.cyberdetox.in/api/report-by-name/filter" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": 20
  }'
```

### Test 4: Search by Name in Specific Session
```bash
curl -X POST "https://school.cyberdetox.in/api/report-by-name/filter" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": 20,
    "search_text": "John"
  }'
```

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

Your API call is working correctly if:

1. ‚úÖ `filters_applied.session_id` shows the value you sent (20)
2. ‚úÖ `total_records` is greater than 0
3. ‚úÖ `data` array contains student records
4. ‚úÖ Student data includes fee details
5. ‚úÖ No error messages

---

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Getting 0 Records

**Possible Causes:**
1. Student 1038 doesn't exist in session 20
2. Student is not enrolled in class 19, section 36 for session 20
3. Database connection issue

**Solution:**
Try without student_id to see all students in that section:
```json
{
    "session_id": 20,
    "class_id": "19",
    "section_id": "36"
}
```

### Issue: session_id Still Shows null

**Cause:** Old code still cached

**Solution:**
1. Clear PHP opcache
2. Restart web server
3. Try again

## üéØ Quick Verification

Run this simple test to verify the fix:

```bash
# Test 1: With session_id
curl -X POST "https://school.cyberdetox.in/api/report-by-name/filter" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -d '{"session_id": 20, "class_id": "19"}' | grep -o '"session_id":[0-9]*'

# Expected output: "session_id":20
```

## üìö Files Changed

1. `api/application/controllers/Report_by_name_api.php` - Added session_id support
2. `api/application/models/Studentfeemaster_model.php` - Updated to accept session_id
