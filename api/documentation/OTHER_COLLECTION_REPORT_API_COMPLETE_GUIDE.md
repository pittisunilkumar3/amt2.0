# Other Collection Report API - Complete Guide

## üéØ Overview

The Other Collection Report API retrieves other fee collection data (additional fees like library, sports, hostel fees, etc.). This API **matches the exact behavior** of the web interface at `http://localhost/amt/financereports/other_collection_report`.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and Working  
**Base URL:** `http://localhost/amt/api`

---

## üîë Key Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Uses Same Model as Web Interface**
   - Calls `studentfeemasteradding_model->getFeeCollectionReport()`
   - Same method used by web page

2. **Parses JSON amount_detail Field**
   - Each deposit record contains JSON with multiple payments
   - Model extracts individual payments from JSON
   - Returns payment records, not deposit records

3. **Filters from JSON, Not Table Columns**
   - `received_by` is in JSON, not a column
   - `date` is in JSON, not a column
   - `payment_mode` is in JSON, not a column
   - Model parses JSON to apply filters

4. **Returns Individual Payments**
   - One deposit can have multiple payments (sub-invoices)
   - Each payment is a separate record in response
   - Includes full student and fee details

## üìä Database Structure

### Table: `student_fees_depositeadding`

```sql
CREATE TABLE `student_fees_depositeadding` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `student_fees_master_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `fee_groups_feetype_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `student_transport_fee_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `amount_detail` text DEFAULT NULL,  -- ‚úÖ JSON field with payments
  `is_active` varchar(10) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'no',
  `created_at` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp()
);
```

### JSON Structure in `amount_detail`

```json
{
  "1": {
    "amount": "5000.00",
    "date": "2025-10-10",
    "payment_mode": "Cash",
    "received_by": "123",
    "amount_discount": "0",
    "amount_fine": "0",
    "description": "Library Fee Payment",
    "inv_no": "1"
  },
  "2": {
    "amount": "3000.00",
    "date": "2025-10-11",
    "payment_mode": "Online",
    "received_by": "456",
    "amount_discount": "0",
    "amount_fine": "0",
    "description": "Sports Fee Payment",
    "inv_no": "2"
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Each key ("1", "2") represents a sub-invoice
- `received_by` is a staff ID
- `date` is the actual payment date
- One deposit record can have multiple payments

## üîç How Data is Retrieved

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Query Database**
   - Joins: `student_fees_depositeadding` ‚Üí `fee_groups_feetypeadding` ‚Üí `fee_groupsadding` ‚Üí `feetypeadding` ‚Üí `student_fees_masteradding` ‚Üí `student_session` ‚Üí `classes` ‚Üí `sections` ‚Üí `students`
   - Filters by: class_id, section_id, session_id, feetype_id (table columns)

2. **Parse JSON for Each Deposit**
   - Decode `amount_detail` JSON field
   - Extract individual payments (sub-invoices)

3. **Filter Payments by Date**
   - Check if payment date (from JSON) falls within date range
   - Only include payments within range

4. **Filter Payments by Collector** (if specified)
   - Check if `received_by` (from JSON) matches filter
   - Only include matching payments

5. **Build Response Records**
   - For each payment that passes filters:
     - Include deposit record fields (id, student info, fee info)
     - Include payment fields from JSON (amount, date, payment_mode, etc.)
     - Look up collector name from staff table

6. **Group Results** (if grouping specified)
   - Group by class_id, received_by, or payment_mode
   - Calculate subtotals for each group

## ‚ú® Key Differences from Simple Query

| Simple Database Query | This API (Matches Web) |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Returns deposit records | Returns individual payment records |
| One record per deposit | Multiple records per deposit (one per payment) |
| Cannot filter by date accurately | Filters by actual payment date from JSON |
| Cannot filter by received_by | Filters by collector from JSON |
| Shows created_at timestamp | Shows actual payment date |
| Missing payment details | Includes all payment details |

---

## üéØ Use Cases

1. **Daily Collection Report** - Filter by today's date
2. **Monthly Collection Report** - Filter by this_month
3. **Collector-wise Report** - Filter by received_by and group by collection
4. **Class-wise Report** - Filter by class and group by class
5. **Fee Type Report** - Filter by feetype_id
6. **Custom Period Report** - Use date_from and date_to
