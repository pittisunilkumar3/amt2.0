# Other Collection Report API - Final Documentation

## üéâ Status: Fixed and Working

Both issues have been resolved:
1. ‚úÖ Database connection error fixed
2. ‚úÖ API response structure matches web interface table exactly

---

## üîß Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Database Connection Error

**Problem:** API was returning database connection error even though MySQL was running.

**Root Cause:** Overly aggressive error handling in constructor was catching and suppressing all errors, including model loading errors.

**Solution:** Removed try-catch block and error suppression. Let CodeIgniter handle database connection naturally.

**Before:**
```php
try {
    $this->load->database();
    if (!$this->db->conn_id) {
        throw new Exception('Database connection failed');
    }
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo json_encode(['status' => 0, 'message' => 'Database connection error']);
    exit;
}
```

**After:**
```php
// Load database normally - CodeIgniter handles errors
$this->load->database();
```

### Issue 2: API Response Structure

**Problem:** API response didn't match the web interface table columns.

**Solution:** Formatted response to match exact table structure from web page.

**Web Interface Table Columns:**
1. Payment ID (id/inv_no)
2. Date (payment date from JSON)
3. Admission No
4. Name (full student name)
5. Class (class + section)
6. Fee Type
7. Collect By (collector name + employee ID)
8. Mode (payment mode)
9. Paid (amount)
10. Note (description)
11. Discount
12. Fine
13. Total (Paid + Fine - Discount)

## üß™ Testing

### Test 1: List Endpoint (Filter Options)

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost/amt/api/other-collection-report/list" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -d '{}'
```

**Expected:** Returns filter options (classes, fee types, collectors, etc.)

---

### Test 2: Filter Endpoint (All Records)

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost/amt/api/other-collection-report/filter" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -d '{}'
```

**Expected:** Returns all other fee payments for current year with formatted columns

---

### Test 3: Filter by Today

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost/amt/api/other-collection-report/filter" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -d '{
    "search_type": "today"
  }'
```

**Expected:** Returns today's payments with all table columns

---

### Test 4: Filter with Grouping

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost/amt/api/other-collection-report/filter" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -d '{
    "search_type": "this_month",
    "group": "class"
  }'
```

**Expected:** Returns grouped results with subtotals
