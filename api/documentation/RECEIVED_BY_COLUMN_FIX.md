# Received By Column Fix - Complete Solution

## 🐛 Error Description

**Error Number:** 1054  
**Error Message:** Unknown column 'received_by' in 'field list'

**SQL Query That Failed:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `received_by`
FROM `student_fees_depositeadding`
WHERE `received_by` IS NOT NULL
AND `received_by` != ''
```

**Root Cause:** The `student_fees_depositeadding` table (and `student_fees_deposite` table) **do not have a `received_by` column**. The collector information is stored inside the JSON `amount_detail` field, not as a separate column.

---

## 📊 Database Structure

### Table: `student_fees_depositeadding`

```sql
CREATE TABLE `student_fees_depositeadding` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `student_fees_master_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `fee_groups_feetype_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `student_transport_fee_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `amount_detail` text DEFAULT NULL,  -- ✅ JSON field containing payment details
  `is_active` varchar(10) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'no',
  `created_at` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp()
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```

### JSON Structure in `amount_detail`

```json
{
  "1": {
    "amount": "5000.00",
    "date": "2025-10-10",
    "payment_mode": "Cash",
    "received_by": "123",  // ✅ Staff ID stored here
    "description": "Library Fee Payment",
    "inv_no": "1"
  },
  "2": {
    "amount": "3000.00",
    "date": "2025-10-11",
    "payment_mode": "Online",
    "received_by": "456",
    "description": "Sports Fee Payment",
    "inv_no": "2"
  }
}
```

**Key Point:** `received_by` is stored as a **staff ID** inside the JSON, not as a table column.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### The Fix

Instead of querying the `student_fees_depositeadding` table for `received_by` values, we now get the list of collectors from the `staff` table using the existing model method.

**Before (Incorrect):**
```php
// Tried to query non-existent column
$this->db->distinct();
$this->db->select('received_by');
$this->db->from('student_fees_depositeadding');
$this->db->where('received_by IS NOT NULL');
$received_by_list = $this->db->get()->result_array();
```

**After (Correct):**
```php
// Get list of staff who can collect fees
$collect_by_data = $this->studentfeemaster_model->get_feesreceived_by();

// Convert to array format for API response
$received_by_list = array();
if (!empty($collect_by_data)) {
    foreach ($collect_by_data as $staff_id => $staff_name) {
        $received_by_list[] = array(
            'id' => $staff_id,
            'name' => $staff_name
        );
    }
}
```

### How `get_feesreceived_by()` Works

This method queries the `staff` table to get active staff members who can collect fees:

```php
public function get_feesreceived_by()
{
    $result = $this->db->select('CONCAT_WS(" ",staff.name,staff.surname) as name, staff.employee_id,staff.id')
        ->from('staff')
        ->join('staff_roles', 'staff.id=staff_roles.staff_id')
        ->where('staff.is_active', '1')
        ->get()
        ->result_array();
    
    foreach ($result as $key => $value) {
        $data[$value['id']] = $value['name'] . " (" . $value['employee_id'] . ")";
    }
    return $data;
}
```

**Returns:** Array with staff_id as key and "Name (Employee ID)" as value

## 🎯 Why This Approach is Better

### ✅ Advantages

1. **Matches Web Interface** - Uses the same method as the web application
2. **Correct Data Source** - Gets collectors from staff table, not payment records
3. **Complete List** - Shows all staff who can collect fees, not just those who have collected
4. **Consistent** - Same approach across all collection report APIs
5. **Maintainable** - Uses existing model method instead of duplicate queries
6. **Accurate** - Staff names and employee IDs are always up-to-date

### ❌ Why Previous Approach Failed

1. **Wrong Table** - Queried `student_fees_depositeadding` which doesn't have `received_by` column
2. **Wrong Data Type** - `received_by` is in JSON field, not a column
3. **Incomplete List** - Would only show collectors who have already collected fees
4. **Inconsistent** - Different from web interface behavior

## 🔍 How Filtering Works

When a user filters by `received_by` in the filter endpoint:

1. **API receives:** `{"received_by": "123"}` (staff ID)
2. **Model processes:** Parses JSON `amount_detail` field for each payment
3. **Model filters:** Checks if `amount_detail.received_by` matches the staff ID
4. **API returns:** Only payments collected by that staff member

**Example from model:**
```php
public function findObjectByCollectId($array, $st_date, $ed_date, $receivedBy)
{
    $ar = json_decode($array->amount_detail);
    $result_array = array();
    
    if (!empty($ar)) {
        foreach ($ar as $row_key => $row_value) {
            if (isset($row_value->received_by)) {
                if ($row_value->received_by == $receivedBy) {
                    // Include this payment
                    $result_array[] = $row_value;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return $result_array;
}
```
