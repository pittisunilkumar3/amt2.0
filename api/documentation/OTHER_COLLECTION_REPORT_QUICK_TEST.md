## ✅ Success Indicators

Your API is working correctly if:

1. ✅ No database errors
2. ✅ `status: 1` in response
3. ✅ `received_by` list is populated in list endpoint
4. ✅ `data` array contains records in filter endpoint
5. ✅ `total_amount` is calculated correctly
6. ✅ Filters work as expected
7. ✅ Grouping works when specified

---

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Getting Database Error

**Cause:** PHP opcache might be caching old code

**Solution:**
1. Restart Apache in XAMPP
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try again

---

### Issue: Empty received_by List

**Cause:** No data in `student_fees_depositeadding` table

**Solution:** This is normal if no other fees have been collected yet

---

### Issue: 0 Records Returned

**Possible Causes:**
1. No other fee collection data for the specified filters
2. Session filter is too restrictive
3. Date range doesn't match any records

**Solution:** Try with empty filter `{}` to see all records

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Before Fix ❌
```sql
SELECT `DISTINCT` `received_by`  -- Error: DISTINCT wrapped in backticks
FROM `student_fees_depositeadding`
```

### After Fix ✅
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `received_by`  -- Correct: DISTINCT is a keyword
FROM `student_fees_depositeadding`
```

### Code Change
```php
// Before
$this->db->select('DISTINCT received_by');

// After
$this->db->distinct();
$this->db->select('received_by');
```
