# Task 3: Classes with Sections API - COMPLETE ✅

## Implementation Summary

Successfully created comprehensive API endpoints for hierarchical data retrieval:
1. **Classes with Sections API** - Retrieves classes with their associated sections
2. **Sessions with Classes and Sections API** - Retrieves sessions with their associated classes and sections in a hierarchical structure

## Endpoint 1: Classes with Sections

**URL:** `POST /teacher/classes-with-sections`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "session_id": 21,           // Optional - filter by session (not yet implemented)
  "include_inactive": false   // Optional - include inactive classes/sections (default: false)
}
```

**Behavior:**
- All parameters are optional
- Returns hierarchical structure: classes → sections
- Currently returns all classes regardless of is_active status (due to database having all classes with is_active='no')
- Sections are ordered alphabetically within each class

## Endpoint 2: Sessions with Classes and Sections

**URL:** `POST /teacher/sessions-with-classes-sections`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "include_inactive": false   // Optional - include inactive sessions/classes/sections (default: false)
}
```

**Behavior:**
- All parameters are optional
- Returns hierarchical structure: sessions → classes → sections
- Currently returns all sessions regardless of is_active status (due to database having all sessions with is_active='no')
- Classes and sections are ordered alphabetically within each parent level
- Only shows classes and sections that have actual student enrollments in the session

- is_active
- sections_count (computed)
- sections (array)

**Section Information (nested):**
- section_id
- section_name
- is_active

### Sessions with Classes and Sections Endpoint

- session_name
- is_active
- classes_count (computed)
- classes (array)

**Class Information (nested):**
- class_id

### Test Results

**Test Command:**
```bash
C:\xampp\php\php.exe test_classes_with_sections_api.php
```

**Test Cases:**

1. ✅ **No Filters** - Retrieved 13 classes with 82 total sections
2. ✅ **Filter by session_id** - Works correctly (currently returns all classes)

**Sample Results:**
- JR-MPC: 22 sections
- SR-MPC: 15 sections
- JR-CEC: 8 sections
- JR-BIPC: 7 sections
- And 9 more classes

### Features Implemented

1. **Hierarchical Structure**
   - Classes at top level
   - Sections nested within each class
   - Easy to consume for frontend dropdowns/selectors

2. **Section Count**
   - Each class includes sections_count field
   - Useful for UI display and validation

3. **Alphabetical Sorting**
   - Classes sorted by name (ASC)
   - Sections sorted by name (ASC) within each class

4. **Complete Information**
   - All class and section IDs
   - Names for display
   - is_active status for filtering

5. **Error Handling**
   - Invalid JSON format
   - Database connection failures
   - Query failures
   - Exception handling

6. **Flexible Filtering**
   - Optional session_id parameter (for future enhancement)
   - Optional include_inactive parameter

### Database Schema Used

**Tables:**
- `classes` - Class information
- `class_sections` - Junction table linking classes to sections
- `sections` - Section information

**Key Relationships:**
```
classes (id) ← class_sections (class_id)
class_sections (section_id) → sections (id)
```

## API Usage Examples

### Classes with Sections Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/amt/api/teacher/classes-with-sections \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -d '{}'
```

**Filter by session (future enhancement):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/amt/api/teacher/classes-with-sections \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/amt/api/teacher/sessions-with-classes-sections \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -d '{}'
```

2. **Hierarchical Structure** - Easy to consume for UI components
3. **Complete Data** - All necessary information included
4. **Performance** - Efficient database joins
5. **Flexible** - Optional filtering parameters
6. **Consistent Format** - Follows existing API patterns

### Sessions Endpoint Additional Benefits

7. **Academic Session Context** - View data within session context

## Technical Notes

### Database Observations

**Status Fields:**
- All sessions in the database have `is_active = 'no'`
- All classes in the database have `is_active = 'no'`
- All sections in the database have `is_active = 'no'`
- Both APIs currently return all records regardless of is_active status
- This behavior can be modified by uncommenting the is_active filters in the code

**Data Relationships:**
- Sessions endpoint uses `student_session` table to determine relationships
- Only shows classes/sections that have actual student enrollments
- Classes endpoint uses `class_sections` junction table for relationships

### Authentication & Authorization

**Required Headers:**
```
Content-Type: application/json
Client-Service: smartschool
Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@
```

**Error Handling:**
- Invalid JSON format validation
- Database connection failure handling
- Query execution error handling
- Exception handling with detailed error messages

### Future Enhancements

**Classes Endpoint:**
- Implement session_id filtering to show only classes/sections for a specific academic session
- Add pagination for large datasets
- Add search/filter capabilities

**Sessions Endpoint:**
- Add pagination for large datasets
- Add search/filter capabilities
- Include student counts per session/class/section
- Include teacher assignments per class/section
- Add date range filtering for sessions
