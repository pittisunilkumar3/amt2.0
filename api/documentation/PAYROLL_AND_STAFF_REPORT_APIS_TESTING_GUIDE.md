## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Unable to locate the model"
**Solution:** Ensure all required models exist in `api/application/models/` folder

### Issue 2: "Unauthorized access"
**Solution:** Check authentication headers are correct:
- `Client-Service: smartschool`
- `Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@`

### Issue 3: Empty data array
**Solution:** This is normal if no records exist in database. Check database tables:
- `staff_payslip` for payroll data
- `staff` for staff data

### Issue 4: SQL errors
**Solution:** Check database connection and table structures
