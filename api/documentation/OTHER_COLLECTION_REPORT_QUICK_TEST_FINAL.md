  -d '{}'
```

**Expected Result:**

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Getting Database Error

**Solution:** 
1. Verify MySQL is running in XAMPP
2. Check database credentials in `api/application/config/database.php`
3. Ensure database name is correct (default: 'amt')

---

### Issue: Missing Fields in Response

**Solution:**
1. Clear PHP opcache
2. Restart Apache in XAMPP
3. Try again

---

### Issue: Collector Shows Only ID

**Solution:**
- This means `received_byname` is not set in model response
- Check if `staff_model->get_StaffNameById()` is working
- Verify staff table has the collector record

---

### Issue: Total Not Calculated

**Solution:**
- Check if `amount`, `amount_fine`, and `amount_discount` fields exist
- Verify calculation: Total = Paid + Fine - Discount

---

## 🎯 Compare with Web Interface

To verify the API matches the web interface:

1. Open web page: `http://localhost/amt/financereports/other_collection_report`
2. Apply same filters in both web and API
3. Compare the data:
   - Same number of records
   - Same payment IDs
   - Same amounts
   - Same totals

---

## 📊 Example Comparison

### Web Interface Table:
```
Payment ID | Date       | Admission No | Name     | Class        | ...
123/1      | 2025-10-11 | 2025001      | John Doe | Class 10 (A) | ...
```

### API Response:
```json
{
    "payment_id": "123/1",
    "date": "2025-10-11",
    "admission_no": "2025001",
    "student_name": "John Doe",
    "class": "Class 10 (A)",
    ...
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Matches exactly!
