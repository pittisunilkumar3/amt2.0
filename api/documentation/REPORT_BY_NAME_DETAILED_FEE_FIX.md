# Report By Name API - Detailed Fee Information Fix

## Issue Reported

The Report By Name API was only returning basic summary information (total_fee, deposit, discount, fine, balance) instead of the complete detailed fee structure that the web page displays.

**Previous Response (Incomplete):**
```json
{
    "student_id": "2481",
    "admission_no": "2025 SR-ONTC-52",
    "firstname": "ADUSURI",
    "lastname": "NANDHINI",
    "total_fee": "33,300.00",
    "deposit": "0.00",
    "discount": "0.00",
    "fine": "0.00",
    "balance": "33,300.00"
}
```

**Missing Information:**
- ❌ Fee group names
- ❌ Individual fee types
- ❌ Fee amounts per type
- ❌ Payment history
- ❌ Payment dates and modes
- ❌ Due dates
- ❌ Student discount details
- ❌ Transport fees

---

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added `getStudentFeesByClassSectionStudent()` Method to API Model

**File:** `api/application/models/Studentfeemaster_model.php`

This method returns the complete fee structure including:
- Student information
- Fee groups with nested fee types
- Payment history for each fee type
- Student discount information
- All fee details (amounts, due dates, fines)

```php
public function getStudentFeesByClassSectionStudent($class_id = null, $section_id = null, $student_id = null)
{
    // Returns detailed fee structure matching web page
    // Includes fee groups, fee types, payment history, discounts
}
```

#### 2. Updated Report_by_name_api Controller

**File:** `api/application/controllers/Report_by_name_api.php`

Changed from using `getStudentFees()` (summary only) to `getStudentFeesByClassSectionStudent()` (detailed structure):

```php
// OLD CODE (Summary only):
$student_fees = $this->studentfeemaster_model->getStudentFees($student['student_session_id']);
// Only returned summary totals

// NEW CODE (Detailed structure):
$student_due_fee = $this->studentfeemaster_model->getStudentFeesByClassSectionStudent($class_id, $section_id, $student_id);
// Returns complete fee structure with groups, types, payment history
```

#### 3. Added Transport Fees Integration

The API now checks for transport fees and includes them in the response:

```php
// Check if transport module is active
$module = $this->module_model->getPermissionByModulename('transport');

if (!empty($module) && isset($module['is_active']) && $module['is_active']) {
    $transport_fees = $this->studentfeemaster_model->getStudentTransportFees($student_session_id, $route_pickup_point_id);
}
```

#### 4. Added Required Models

- Added `feediscount_model` to Studentfeemaster_model constructor
- Added `module_model` to Report_by_name_api controller
