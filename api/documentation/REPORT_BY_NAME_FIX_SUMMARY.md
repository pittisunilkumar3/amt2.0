## 🔧 **Changes Made**

**File:** `api/application/models/Studentfeemaster_model.php`

Added `getStudentFeesByClassSectionStudent()` method that returns:

Changed from:
```php
// OLD: Only summary
$student_fees = $this->studentfeemaster_model->getStudentFees($student_session_id);
```

To:
```php
// NEW: Complete details
$student_due_fee = $this->studentfeemaster_model->getStudentFeesByClassSectionStudent($class_id, $section_id, $student_id);
```

### 3. **Added Transport Fees Integration**
```php
// Check if transport module is active
$module = $this->module_model->getPermissionByModulename('transport');
if ($module['is_active']) {
    $transport_fees = $this->studentfeemaster_model->getStudentTransportFees(...);
}
```

### 4. **Added Required Models**
