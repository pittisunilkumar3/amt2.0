# Due Fees Report API - Session Filtering Fix

## üìã Overview

Fixed the Due Fees Report API endpoint (`/api/due-fees-report/filter`) to properly handle session-based filtering. The API now correctly filters students by session and displays their fee information for the selected session.

---

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Critical SQL Join Issue - No Data Returned**
**Problem:** The API was using the wrong JOIN condition for `fee_groups_feetype` table:
- **API (Wrong):** `INNER JOIN fee_groups_feetype ON student_fees_master.fee_session_group_id = fee_groups_feetype.fee_session_group_id`
- **Web (Correct):** `INNER JOIN fee_groups_feetype ON fee_groups.id = fee_groups_feetype.fee_groups_id`

This caused the API to return 0 records because it was too restrictive in matching fee types.

**Solution:** Changed the SQL query to match the web version exactly:
- Join `fee_groups_feetype` by `fee_groups_id` instead of `fee_session_group_id`
- This ensures all fee types for the fee group are included
- Students are filtered by session (`student_session.session_id`)
- Fee types are matched by fee group, not by session group

### 2. **Wrong JOIN in studentDepositByFeeGroupFeeTypeArray Method**
**Problem:** The fee detail retrieval method was also using the wrong JOIN condition.

**Solution:** Updated to match the web version:
- Start from `fee_groups_feetype` table
- Join to `student_fees_master` by `fee_session_group_id`
- This ensures correct fee details are retrieved

### 3. **Unclear Response Information**
**Problem:** API responses didn't clearly indicate what filters were applied and how they affected the results.

**Solution:** Enhanced response to include:
- Detailed filter information
- Clear messages about what data is being returned
- Session-specific context in the response message

### 4. **Missing Input Validation**
**Problem:** The `studentDepositByFeeGroupFeeTypeArray` method didn't validate input arrays.

**Solution:** Added validation to check for empty or invalid fee type arrays.

## üîß Technical Changes

### Files Modified

#### 1. **api/application/models/Studentfeemaster_model.php**

**Method: `getStudentDueFeeTypesByDatee()`** (Lines 229-313)

**Critical Change - Fixed JOIN Condition:**

**BEFORE (Wrong):**
```sql
INNER JOIN fee_groups_feetype ON student_fees_master.fee_session_group_id = fee_groups_feetype.fee_session_group_id
```

**AFTER (Correct - Matches Web Version):**
```sql
INNER JOIN fee_groups_feetype ON fee_groups.id = fee_groups_feetype.fee_groups_id
```

**Why This Matters:**
- The old JOIN was too restrictive and required exact `fee_session_group_id` match
- The new JOIN matches by `fee_groups_id`, which is how the web version works
- This allows all fee types for a fee group to be included, not just those with matching session groups

**Other Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Removed unnecessary `fee_session_groups.session_id` filter (only filter students by session)
- ‚úÖ Simplified SELECT clause to match web version
- ‚úÖ Updated documentation to reflect actual behavior
- ‚úÖ Maintained session filtering for students (`student_session.session_id`)

**SQL Query Logic:**
```sql
WHERE student_session.session_id = {session_id}          -- Filter students by session
  AND student_session.class_id = {class_id}              -- Optional class filter
  AND student_session.section_id = {section_id}          -- Optional section filter
  AND fee_groups_feetype.due_date <= {date}              -- Due date filter
```

**Method: `studentDepositByFeeGroupFeeTypeArray()`** (Lines 315-355)

**Critical Change - Rewritten to Match Web Version:**

**BEFORE (Wrong):**
```sql
SELECT student_fees_master.*, fee_session_groups.*, ...
FROM student_fees_master
INNER JOIN fee_session_groups ON ...
INNER JOIN fee_groups_feetype ON student_fees_master.fee_session_group_id = fee_groups_feetype.fee_session_group_id
```

**AFTER (Correct - Matches Web Version):**
```sql
SELECT fee_groups_feetype.*, student_fees_master.*, ...
FROM fee_groups_feetype
INNER JOIN student_fees_master ON student_fees_master.fee_session_group_id = fee_groups_feetype.fee_session_group_id
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Start from `fee_groups_feetype` table instead of `student_fees_master`
- This ensures all fee types are included in the result
- Matches the exact logic used in the web version

**Other Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added input validation for empty or invalid arrays
- ‚úÖ Added `intval()` sanitization for fee type IDs
- ‚úÖ Returns empty array for invalid input
- ‚úÖ Simplified query structure to match web version

#### 2. **api/application/controllers/Due_fees_report_api.php**

**Method: `filter()`** (Lines 73-95, 162-192)

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added debug logging for filter parameters
- ‚úÖ Added debug logging for raw query results count
- ‚úÖ Enhanced response message to include applied filters
- ‚úÖ Added `filter_info` section in response with human-readable filter descriptions
- ‚úÖ Improved comments explaining session filtering behavior

**New Response Structure:**
```json
{
    "status": 1,
    "message": "Due fees report retrieved successfully for session ID 25",
    "filters_applied": {
        "class_id": null,
        "section_id": null,
        "session_id": "25",
        "date": "2025-01-10"
    },
    "filter_info": {
        "session_filter": "Students enrolled in session 25 with fees for that session",
        "class_filter": "All classes",
        "section_filter": "All sections",
        "due_date_filter": "Fees due on or before 2025-01-10"
    },
    "total_records": 150,
    "data": [...],
    "timestamp": "2025-01-10 14:30:00"
}
```

## üìä How Session Filtering Works

### Database Structure

The fee system uses the following key tables:

1. **`student_session`** - Links students to sessions
   - `id` (student_session_id)
   - `student_id`
   - `session_id` ‚Üê Session filter applied here
   - `class_id`
   - `section_id`

2. **`fee_session_groups`** - Links fee groups to sessions
   - `id` (fee_session_group_id)
   - `fee_groups_id`
   - `session_id` ‚Üê Session filter applied here

3. **`student_fees_master`** - Links students to fee groups
   - `student_session_id` ‚Üí References `student_session.id`
   - `fee_session_group_id` ‚Üí References `fee_session_groups.id`

4. **`fee_groups_feetype`** - Fee types within fee groups
   - `fee_session_group_id`
   - `due_date` ‚Üê Due date filter applied here

### Filtering Logic

When `session_id` is provided:

1. **Student Filter:** Only students enrolled in that session are included
   ```sql
   student_session.session_id = {session_id}
   ```

2. **Fee Group Filter:** Only fee groups assigned to that session are included
   ```sql
   fee_session_groups.session_id = {session_id}
   ```

3. **Result:** Students from the specified session with their fees for that session

When `session_id` is NULL:
- No session filtering is applied
- Returns all students with due fees across all sessions

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Empty Filter
**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost/amt/api/due-fees-report/filter" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

**Expected Result:**
- Returns all active students with due fees
- No session, class, or section filtering
- Includes students from all sessions

### Test Case 2: Filter by Session Only
**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost/amt/api/due-fees-report/filter" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_id": "25"}'
```

**Expected Result:**
- Returns only students enrolled in session 25
- Shows fee groups assigned to session 25
- Includes all classes and sections within that session

### Test Case 3: Filter by Session and Class
**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost/amt/api/due-fees-report/filter" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_id": "25", "class_id": "1"}'
```

**Expected Result:**
- Returns students enrolled in session 25, class 1
- Shows fee groups for session 25
- Includes all sections within class 1

### Test Case 4: Filter by Session, Class, and Section
**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost/amt/api/due-fees-report/filter" \
  -H "Client-Service: smartschool" \
  -H "Auth-Key: schoolAdmin@" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_id": "25", "class_id": "1", "section_id": "1"}'
```

**Expected Result:**
- Returns students enrolled in session 25, class 1, section 1
- Shows fee groups for session 25
- Most specific filtering

## üîç Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging

The API now includes debug logging. To view logs:

1. **Check CodeIgniter logs:**
   ```
   application/logs/log-{date}.php
   ```

2. **Look for entries like:**
   ```
   DEBUG - Due Fees Report API - Filters: class_id=1, section_id=1, session_id=25
   DEBUG - Due Fees Report API - Raw fees_dues count: 45
   ```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: No records returned when session_id is provided

**Possible Causes:**
1. No students enrolled in that session
2. No fee groups assigned to that session
3. No due fees for that session (all fees paid or not yet due)

**Solution:**
- Check `student_session` table for students with that `session_id`
- Check `fee_session_groups` table for fee groups with that `session_id`
- Verify `fee_groups_feetype.due_date` is on or before current date

#### Issue: Wrong students returned

**Possible Causes:**
1. Students have multiple `student_session` records
2. Session ID is incorrect

**Solution:**
- Verify the correct session ID from the `sessions` table
- Check `student_session` table for duplicate entries
