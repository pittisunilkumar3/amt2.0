 * FIX SUMMARY: Advance Payment Amount Storage Issue
 * 
 * PROBLEM: Amount was storing as 0 regardless of advance payment or normal payment
 * 
 * ROOT CAUSE: The advance payment logic was placed AFTER the data array creation,
 * so modifications to $json_array were not affecting the stored amount_detail
